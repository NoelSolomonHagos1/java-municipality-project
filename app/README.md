# Java Municipality Application

An object-oriented programming project using Java. This Android app allows users to search and view statistical data about Finnish municipalities.

The application fetches data from Statistics Finland (Tilastokeskus) API and displays:
- Population development (population size and growth or decline)
- Job self sufficiency
- Employment rate
- Weather, such as the temperature and wind speed

Note: Since this was one of the first school projects, the municipality data is shown correctly, though some labels are not fully visible in the current UI.
